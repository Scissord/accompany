  "harmonic_1_title": "General Provisions",
  "harmonic_1_1_label": "Cargo is accepted for air transportation if its quality, properties, volume, weight, and packaging comply with the transportation regulations of aircraft in accordance with the legislation of Kazakhstan, as well as the laws of the country to, from, or through which the cargo is transported.",
  "harmonic_1_2_label": "Certain types of special cargo (perishable, hazardous, live animals), as well as heavy and oversized cargo, are accepted for transportation upon agreement with the airline in accordance with the conditions set out in these Rules and the requirements of domestic, international, or other regulatory documents.",
  "harmonic_1_3_label": "Cargo must not change its chemical, physical, or other properties in a way that could lead to spoilage or an increased level of danger during transportation.",
  "harmonic_1_4_label": "The dimensions of the cargo are limited by the size of the loading hatches. The total volume of cargo transported on an aircraft is restricted by the size of the baggage and cargo compartments of the aircraft in use. The total weight of transported cargo is limited by the maximum permissible commercial load.",
  "harmonic_1_5_label": "The total weight and volume of cargo transported in the baggage compartments are limited by the permissible maximum load of the baggage compartment according to the Aircraft Loading and Balancing Manual for the respective aircraft type.",
  "harmonic_2_title": "Cargo Waybill",
  "harmonic_2_1_label": "A waybill is an official transport document that accompanies cargo during international transportation. It contains information about the cargo, sender, recipient, transportation conditions, and other details.",
  "harmonic_2_2_label": "Main functions of a waybill: 1. Confirmation of cargo dispatch – the waybill serves as proof of the transportation contract. 2. Cargo information – describes the contents, weight, volume, number of places, and other characteristics. 3. Customs document – used for cargo declaration at customs. 4. Basis for settlements – the transport company's services are paid based on the waybill.",
  "harmonic_3_title": "Acceptance of Cargo for Transportation",
  "harmonic_3_1_label": "The acceptance of cargo for air transportation begins with the sender submitting documents, including the air waybill (AWB) and invoice. At the cargo terminal, the cargo is checked for compliance with declared parameters, weight, packaging, and safety standards. Then, an X-ray inspection is conducted, and additional screening may be performed if necessary. For international shipments, the cargo undergoes customs clearance and receives the status 'ready for carriage' (R4C). After all inspections, it is loaded onto the aircraft for delivery to the recipient.",
  "harmonic_4_title": "Requirements for Cargo Packaging and Labeling",
  "harmonic_4_1_label": "Cargo packaging for air transportation must be durable and protect against damage, moisture, and temperature fluctuations. It must comply with IATA standards, and for dangerous goods, it must meet IATA DGR requirements. The labeling must include information about the sender, recipient, destination airport, and special transportation conditions. Dangerous goods must be marked with hazard class signs and UN codes. All information on the packaging must be clear, resistant to moisture, and protected from mechanical damage.",
  "harmonic_5_title": "Transportation of Lightweight Cargo",
  "harmonic_5_1_label": "The transportation of lightweight cargo in aviation has its specifics, as the cost is calculated based on volumetric weight rather than actual weight. Airlines use the formula: volumetric weight (kg) = (length × width × height in cm) ÷ 6000. If the volumetric weight exceeds the actual weight, the rate is applied accordingly. Lightweight cargo requires compact packaging to minimize volume and proper labeling. To reduce costs, shippers often use vacuum packaging or tightly arrange goods.",
  "harmonic_6_title": "Transportation of Heavy Cargo",
  "harmonic_6_1_label": "The transportation of heavy cargo in aviation requires special preparation and strict compliance with regulations. Such cargo must meet the aircraft's payload capacity and dimensional restrictions, and its loading is carried out using specialized equipment. The cost calculation considers actual weight, the need for reinforced packaging, and fastening methods. The labeling must include 'Heavy Cargo' signs and the center of gravity to ensure proper load distribution. Before shipment, it is important to coordinate transportation conditions with the airline and obtain the necessary permits.",
  "harmonic_7_title": "Transportation of Perishable Cargo",
  "harmonic_7_1_label": "The transportation of perishable cargo by air requires adherence to temperature control and special storage conditions. Such cargo is transported using thermal containers, insulated packaging, or refrigerated aircraft compartments. Fast processing at the airport is crucial, so cargo is labeled 'PERISHABLE' and shipped on priority flights. The sender must specify the allowable storage conditions and expiration date. Customs clearance and transportation should be organized to minimize delays.",
  "harmonic_8_title": "Transportation of Live Animals",
  "harmonic_8_1_label": "The transportation of live animals by air is regulated by the IATA Live Animals Regulations (LAR) and requires special conditions. Animals are transported in certified containers that provide ventilation, comfort, and safety. Veterinary documents, import/export permits, and vaccination records are essential. The container must be labeled 'Live Animals', marked with the correct upright position, and include care instructions. Before the flight, the animal must undergo an inspection, and transportation should be organized with minimal delays.",
